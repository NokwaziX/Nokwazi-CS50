#List months

'''
* Implement a program that prompts the user for a date,
* Month-day-year order,
* Formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636,
* Wherein the month in the latter might be any of the values in the list below:
* Then output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format
* If the userâ€™s input is not a valid date in either format, prompt the user again
* Assume that every month has no more than 31 days; no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days
